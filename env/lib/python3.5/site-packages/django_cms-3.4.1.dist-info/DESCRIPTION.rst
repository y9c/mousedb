.. ATTENTION::

    To propose **significant new features**, open pull requests based on and made against the **develop** branch. It's
    the branch for features that will go into the next django CMS feature release.

    To propose **fixes and backwards-compatible improvements**, please work on the latest **release** branch. This is
    the branch that will become the next PyPI release ("the next version of django CMS").

    Security fixes will be backported to older branches by the core team as appropriate.
